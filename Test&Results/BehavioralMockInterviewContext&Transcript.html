It's an honor to be</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">It's an honor to be here. So I'm a bit about myself. I'm originally from Morocco where I lived pretty much my whole life. I then came to Boston.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">I then came to Boston and studied Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University. While I was in college I did a few different internships.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">internships. I did technical ones at a local power plant and at Amazon Robotics. And I also did one in consulting at the Boston Consulting Group.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the Boston Consulting Group and was also the president of the consulting club at my university. So really I was someone who enjoys both the business.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">enjoy both the business side of things but I also do have a passion for technology. So down the line my goal is to start my own education.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">to start my own education technology company in my home country Morocco so I can make education more affordable through the use of tech and</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">and outside of like school and work I also do magic tricks on college campuses. Oh wow that sounds like a very</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Oh, that sounds like a very impressive background. So, why exactly are you interested in interviewing with our consulting firm?</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">consulting firm? Yeah, my reasons for joining your consulting firm are twofold. Number one, I think the exposure to the strategy work is very appealing.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">is very appealing to me. And then second, the opportunities for externship is also one that I'm highly looking at. So on this strategy,</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So on the strategy side, I know that your consulting firm is one of the few that gives you exposure to C-suite executives and to strategy type products.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">strategy type projects early on in your career, which is something that I won't find at other companies. And then the second reason is the opportunity to do X-turn.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">to do externships. So as I mentioned, I am interested in the education sector down the line and I know that your company offers the opportunity to work.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">opportunity to work for six months at a public sector type company or a nonprofit out in Africa focused on education. So I think...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So I think those are some of the things that highlight appeal to me in your company. Okay, awesome. That's good to know. So now we'll do.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So now we'll dive into a little bit more behavioral questions. So couldn't you tell me about a time where you solved the difficult problem?</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">difficult problem. That's a good question. I think the moment that I can think of is when I was working at the electrical power plant.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">We were trying to launch a new department and my task was to essentially source a supplier. Typically we work with...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Typically we work with a supplier of generators from France, but this time around their capacity and also their pricing did not match our...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">did not match our budget and what we were looking for. So what I ended up doing is I ended up creating a large list of all the different suppliers that I</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the different suppliers that are out there. And then I found a supplier in South Korea that I negotiated with and also was able to bring them in and implant.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the main and implement all of the new generator technology. So that was able to save us a total cost of 10% from the total project.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">from the total project and it was a huge success at the end of it. Awesome. Thank you for sharing that. So next, good.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So next, could you tell me about like one or two of your key strengths? So I would say the biggest two would probably...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">biggest two would probably be my ability to persuade people and then the second would be leadership. I would say those are the biggest two.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Okay, so could you dive a little bit more into that first one your ability to persuade people maybe tell me about a time you're able to convince</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">able to convince someone to change their mind. Yeah, so what I can think of is when I was working in Amazon,</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">in Amazon, one of the big projects that we're trying to launch is the first new robotic facility. But it came out of time when COVID had just hit.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">when COVID had just hit and I was unable to essentially source a lot of the material that we typically get from our Japanese supply.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Japanese supply. So the Vice President of supply chain at the time, his executive decision was to push the launch and push it.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">launch and push it out for a few months. Instead, what I decided to do is try to see if there is a way to still keep the launch.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">to still keep the launch at the same time. And I looked at some of our existing facilities already and tried to store some of the unused material from the...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">used material from there so that we don't delay the launch. So initially the VP of supply chain wanted to delay the launch, but through the analysis.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">But through the analysis, through explaining to him that we could source it from the other facilities, I was able to convince him to not delay the launch.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the launch and instead change the strategy to still be able to get the facility right out on time. Okay great. So now...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So now we'll dive into that second strength you had mentioned. Could you tell me about a time that you demonstrated strong leadership skills?</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">strong leadership skills. Yeah. The one that I can think of is when I was working at the Boston Consulting Group.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">group. There I was leading a big real estate occupancy project where I wanted to essentially showcase what the attendance of each one.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the attendance of each office looked like. What I had to do was then automate the process for a lot of the partners so that they have like a dashboard that they can like.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">dashboard that they can manipulate and change and look at the data. So I had to work with a large team of 15 different developers, software engineers.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">software engineers and data engineers. So I worked with them to essentially gather the data, clean the data and process it.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">and process it and put it and visualize it through Tableau. So that was a great opportunity where I was essentially working with different teams, putting game.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">putting game plans, putting timelines for them. And as I mentioned at the end of it it was a very strong project and the partners were very happy with the dashboard.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">very happy with the dashboard and it was a good like managerial experience for me at the time as well. Awesome that sounds like a very worthwhile experience.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">worthwhile experience. So now that we've talked a little bit about your strengths, maybe you could tell me about a weakness that you'd face in the world.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">that you face in the workforce. Yeah. I'd say the biggest one is probably my ability to prioritize when there's a lot of f---</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">when there's a lot of conflicting and computing priorities. The big one in that case would be, when say there's three or four different--</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">There's three or four different projects and all of them are high-urgency or high-priority. Sometimes a someone who's still very junior in their career. I still don't have that.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">I still don't have that business sense on which one I should tackle first, but I've been trying to improve on it and work on it. So what I do now is I typically</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">I do now is I typically just chat with my manager and try to understand where the business focus should be. Sometimes even just directly ask on.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">directly ask on how I should prioritize some of the work. So I have been improving on that a little bit and I think with some seniority I will hopefully be.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">and you already are hopefully able to get there and understand what I should start with first. Okay, definitely make sense. So those are all the questions.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So those are all the questions that I had for you today. Before we end, do you have any questions for me? Yeah, I think I have two big...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">I think I have two big questions. I think the first one is, as you know, there's a lot of big push for the remote work force.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">remote workforce right now and as a consulting company there's a lot of work and directly with clients or coming in in person to visit the client.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">and to visit the clients, do you think that the consulting business model would necessarily change now that we are in a remote environment?</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">environment. I think that's a big one. And then the second question that I had for you is what are the kind of the big goals of your consulting company?</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">You're a consulting company by say 2025. What are the big milestones that you guys are hoping to achieve and is say international expansion one of those.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">expansion on it, those big milestones that you're looking at. Great, so I think Sia did an amazing...</div></div>
