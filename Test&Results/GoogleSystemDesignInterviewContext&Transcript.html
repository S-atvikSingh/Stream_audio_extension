            <div class="transcription-text" style="margin-top: 5px;"><p>To effectively scale your API, consider implementing a message queue system. This allows you to offload processing tasks, enabling your API to handle more requests concurrently without being overwhelmed.</p><p>For example, you can use tools like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka to manage your queues. Here's a simple example of a REST payload for sending a message to a queue:</p><pre>{<br>  "task": "processData",<br>  "data": {<br>    "id": 123,<br>    "value": "example"<br>  }<br>}</pre><p>Additionally, ensure that you monitor the queue length and processing times to identify bottlenecks. Under high load, if the queue grows too long, it may lead to delays in processing, so consider implementing auto-scaling for your worker nodes.</p><p>For more information on message queues, you can refer to the official documentation: <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html">RabbitMQ Documentation</a> or <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/">Apache Kafka Documentation</a>.</p></div>

This can help in decoupling the tracking API from the data processing logic, allowing for better scalability and reliability.</p><p>For a practical implementation, you might use a message broker like RabbitMQ or AWS SQS. Here’s a simple example of how to publish a message to a queue using AWS SDK in Python:</p><pre><code>import boto3<br><br>sqs = boto3.client('sqs')<br>queue_url = 'https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/MyQueue'<br><br>response = sqs.send_message(<br>    QueueUrl=queue_url,<br>    MessageBody='This is a test message'<br>)</code></pre><p>Additionally, ensure that your queue can handle high loads by implementing proper message batching and monitoring for message processing failures.</p></div>

Can I say...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Can I say there are like 400 million users to start with</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Unicusers, yes, but of course you have to assume that not all of them will be on the app at all times.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So, let me say then 40% of them are active.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">And let's say, an average of two hours of song listening every day.

Okay what is the...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">is expected latency this will help me to desire if it is going to be real time processing or batch processing.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">No, it is not real time, I think it is okay if the lists are refreshed like every R.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Okay, of course going back to what I was saying earlier, I think there are more users in certain parts of the</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">in certain parts of the world like North America and Europe has more users.

Okay, so just make sure that you</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">just make sure that you incorporate that into your design.

I will start with like basic.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">basic blocks. So, before that I just want to know like the scale of the amount of data that I am going to process.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the data that I'm going to process based on the numbers that we just discussed.

So, let's make it wrong. That makes sense.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Yeah, I'll go into the details of it now. Let's say the tracking API it gets.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">API it gets the data and what happens after that I will need some sort of Q2.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">queue to store the data for time being under lit process. So, it can also be the API which is doing the</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">which is doing the processing, but the bandwidth of the API will be used and the scaling of the API.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">it can also always be offloaded and we can also when there is like a peak load we can avoid.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">can avoid data loss. So, I would want to offload as much as possible in order to be able to scale API.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">to scale API and move some of the processing in do the queue and will happen</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">will happen after reading from the queue. So, I will be adding a queue right after the tracking API which it will write.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">which it will write to and my choice of the cube would be Kafka. It is distributed above.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">distributed and scalable. So, it is an industry wide program.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">industry by improving technology. So, I will go ahead with that. So, yeah and after that.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">After that, so now the data is in Kafka.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">event has been captured through the API and it has landed in the Kafka King so far. From here.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So from here I'll have a streaming job which reads from Kafka and copies it over to a bad store.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">to a bad store. So, I am going ahead with a bad system processing here. Since, the minimum latency.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">minimum latency is, I think the maximum latency is one over which can be processed in a batch fashion.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">and we can get the throughput of one hour from the bad systems. So I will have a...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">I will have a streaming job which reads from the Kafka topic and writes it to the Batstore. The store that I choose is like.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">this like HDFS for now it can be S3 can be GCS also.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">GCS also like ok. So, for now I will choose HDFS, I do want to explain the choice a little bit. I think it is a fine choice.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">it's a fine choice. I just want to make sure that you're taking the right considerations into account.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">It's distributed and replicated data and it scales really well for the batch processing. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sounds good.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So, let us go. So, there will be an ETL pipeline on top of this data which would.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">which would process the raw events. Let's say whatever we don't do, HTF as a song, raw events.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">events, right. So, it is for song listening event and e-mail will process them and give a schema to it.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">give a schema to it and show the schema of the song even just to be sure that we are on the same page.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">that we are on the same page. Right. So the song, schema is going to have, let's say song ID.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Let me just type it out here. Okay. Use the righty.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">location and more information like you know if it is an API.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">you know APA credentials or the project something to sort of identify the app that is invoking.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">invoking the API. It is a very much all the IDs and minimal information that we need to.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">you need to further process data, also use lesser bandwidth in the API. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You've written all of this.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">have written all of this to HDFS and so recreating one partition per hour.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Yeah, one partition power would do. And then it can actually be.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">It can actually be like one partition per hour would it be creating too many small files.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Yeah, you don't want too many small files in my state fast. Yeah, so maybe we could append it to a dazed date.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">a day's date directory also. Because these are arrive and not going to be quite often if we store it in like law of</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">in like lot of data in one partition is going to have lesser performance on queries which is ok. This is the data for debugging</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">for debugging purpose and for reference. So I will go with the date partition instead of how early you can say one the.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">say one the names name space and the schema is put on that data and then written to the</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">and then written to the song events. And song events is further processed through a same detail or another detail which will sort of.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">which will sort of join it with other metadata like song metadata and album metadata and then write it out as ended song</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">and its song events.
