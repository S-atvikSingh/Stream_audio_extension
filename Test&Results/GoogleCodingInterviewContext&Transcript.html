Performing actions outside of a loop can reduce the number of iterations and improve performance, especially in cases where the operation does not depend on the loop variable. <br><br>For example, if you are processing a list of items, and you have a calculation that does not change with each iteration, it is more efficient to compute it once before the loop starts. This can significantly enhance performance under high load conditions. <br><br>Additionally, consider the implications of your loop structure on memory usage and execution time. If you are iterating over large datasets, ensure that you are not inadvertently creating unnecessary copies of data or holding onto references longer than needed.</div>

            <div class="transcription-text" style="margin-top: 5px;"><p>To track the maximum value within a for loop, you can initialize a variable before the loop starts to hold the maximum value found so far. During each iteration, compare the current value with this variable and update it if the current value is greater. Here’s a simple example in Python:</p><pre><code>max_value = float('-inf')  # Initialize to negative infinity<br>for number in numbers:<br>    if number &gt; max_value:<br>        max_value = number<br></code></pre><p>This approach ensures that you efficiently find the maximum value in a single pass through the data.</p><p>For further reading on loops and conditionals, you can check the official Python documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html">Python Control Flow</a>.</p></div>

            <div class="transcription-text" style="margin-top: 5px;">In programming, when determining the maximum number from a set of values, you can use the built-in function to simplify the process. For example, in Python, you can use the following code snippet:<br><br>```python<br>max_num = max(values)<br>```<br><br>This approach is efficient and leverages the language's capabilities to handle the operation without manual iteration.<br><br>However, it's important to consider how this logic might fail under heavy load, such as when processing a very large dataset.

So when I'm at this one right here, I ask the square, I ask right of me how big of a square.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">big of a square can you be. And if let's say this whole area had ones, even though it doesn't, if it had all ones, the right of me</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">once the writer means to say "oh I can do a 3 by 3" and I'm gonna try to break this down into maybe one step at a time.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">step out of time. So, when I ask this one, how many ones do you have, how big of a square can you form? It could</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">It could ask the one right of it how many can you form it can ask the the bottom of it. How can many can you form?</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">And then if, whichever, so whichever.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So whichever returns the minimum I will take that and I'll add one to it trying to think</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">But trying to think if this will always be correct. So if this one said I can do a two by two, let's say a.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Let's say it's it clearly can do a 2 by 2. I'm gonna change your input by a little bit if that's okay. So which means this would have been one of this would have been</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">I mean, one, this would have been a one. Okay, this, the one that I'm highlighting is asking the one right of it, how big can you, can you be your square could be</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Q squared could be this will say oh I can do a two then it's as the bottom of it how big of a square can you do</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">you do in this particular case is going to say three because I can see the ones like</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">see the ones like here this one.

Yes, that makes sense.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">And let me see if taking the minimum is sufficient so to speak. So this one...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So this one can create a 3 by 3, yes. The one right of it can create a 2 by 2, or I guess...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Or I guess now the example is so corrupted because I kept changing things. Let's see actually this one yes, so this</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So this one maybe I should color. So let me color this to red. The red one will say I can do.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">we'll say I can do a 2x2 starting from this coordinate.

It would still be the minimum.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the minimum.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">And now we can think about the base cases of the recursion, so to speak. So the base case, if we had a zero, then we can't do it.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">then we can't do it, we return zero. Yes, if we had a one, then we ask the right and the...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">right and the bottom to do the recursion.

Yes, I'm trying to think at which case do we in which case do we grow? I'm thinking we can grow.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">we can grow, let me think. So if this, if the right one hypothetically said, I could do a 3 by 3.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">3 by 3, I'm just thinking.

We have to try to five or something eventually. So if the right of me can say I can do a 3 by 3, which, you know, it's</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">which you know it so maybe i can hack the numbers again just for the sake of example it can say i can do a three by three actually</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Actually, this is a still a 2 by 2. Okay, I have to do this as a one. So the red one can now do a 3 by 3.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">3 by 3. The blue one can also do... - So, you can buy 3. - Only 3 by 3, exactly.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">then this one is so far as you're gonna say 3 is the number.

(buzzing)</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the diagonal number would also be 3, to which case because you have a 1.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">you have a one in that first field at the zero one coordinates.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">it's what could that say if all of the three values down diagonal into your right are all.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">into your right are all three and this is a one what could that be make sense okay so if all the values a</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Because R3 then I should say I can do 4.

Okay, so</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Okay, so programming Python into a document.

So...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So we want to make an all zero, I'm going to do this.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">this.

Thank you for making this clarification.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So then I will do this as my n times m. Now I can say something like this.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">something like this.

That if an index ij exists in dp, then it must also exist in binary. Awesome. OK.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Okay, so my DP star should all zero. Now we're gonna do the double four loop that we mentioned. So for I and rain.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">in range and porce and range M.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">m and here at every square we're gonna write the maxing that we</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the maximum that we could do.

So let me think.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">- First, if the entry of the zero, I've been away of...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">of ij is 0, then the DP will have a 0 in it.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">in it.

I can just continue.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">I can just continue. I can skip to the next iteration if I'm allowed to use the content. Yeah, yeah, of course. Awesome. Okay, so.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Okay, so then at any entry that's not a zero, we should look up the left.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the left and the top and the diagonal and we'll see their values.

I'll set them later to the diagonal value all to zero.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">all to zero and I'll set them conditionally, why? Because I don't want to, I want to skip the boundary conditions. So if.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So if the left of me if I is greater than 0, that means I'm not at the boundary. That means the left could be something.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">is the left could be something that's not zero. So now we set the left to DP of i minus 1j.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">one, j. And I want to do the same thing, similar thing, to the right one.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the right one, otherwise they stick.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Otherwise, they will stay as you are. Quick question. Is it possible to handle the bounce?</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the boundaries before you enter this scope?</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Yes, I'm sure. So we could copy the boundaries from...</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">from the input verbatim to the DP and then our loop could be starting from one.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">starting from one surface.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">You are in the zero index of the row or the column if there is a handling you could do before you enter this scope.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">you enter the scope of setting the left and right diagonal indices.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So you're saying like before we enter these loops we should handle the borders. Maybe that's what I'm hearing.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Maybe that's what I'm hearing. Maybe yeah. I think it's possible to do it within the loop if you'd like. We could.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">We could. Or let me know if that doesn't sound right. We could do it. So you are saying that perhaps instead of.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Perhaps instead of having these if statements inside the for loop I could do something before then I no longer need these if statements you could do it</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">You could do it outside of the for loop you could do within the for loop either way. I see. Okay. So yes, I could do that. I mean the.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">I could do that. I mean, there are many ways to do it. So I want to think that, yes.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Yes, okay, so how about I wonder if if it will complain okay, so mathematics is</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Okay, so mathematically speaking, I can do this left. Let me know what you think about this.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">you think about this. So what if I set it to that and then I just multiply by a Boolean expression.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">i is greater than zero. So what I'm trying to do is to say</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">to say the eye greater than zero this Boolean condition will only be valid will only say one.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">only say one if I'm not, I'm not at the boundary. If I'm at the boundary then I can say your letter zero. Is that a? Yeah, that</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Yeah, that's possible. That's possible. But then the value is 1. Then the maximum square could still be 1.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">be one even in the row and column like the edges. Right. So I still so yes.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So yes, you hear like this right and left and I, so far, they're just for reading. I still haven't inserted any.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">inserted anything into the DP. Okay. My plan is to insert in a moment like perhaps right now. Awesome. Okay.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Okay, so if if i is greater than 0 and j is greater than 0.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">than zero. And now I can read my diagonal, diagonal is equal to I'm going to copy the line 4.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the line 4, I'm just add a minus 1, and now I want to write it to the DP at this moment right here. So a</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">So we just like we're brainstorming if they're all set.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">then I'll read the minimum of the three and increment by one. If there are not else.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">if they're not all set then I'll just read the minimum. Yes. And what would be the deciding factor for the?</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">deciding factor for that, whether the, yeah, what would be the deciding factor of that? So to increment by one? Yes.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Yes, basically the array entry should have unknown 0.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">have</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">nested for loop that if we are at zero then we just skip parentry we keep it in the dp as zero okay so if the code flows until this</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">flows until this point, then here I know that it's a non-zero point and the top</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the top, the left and the diagonal have some numbers and using those numbers, the top left or right.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">the top left or right, some of them could be zeros, the top left diagonal, some of them could be zeros.

If left is greater than 0,</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">and write is greater than 0 and the egg is greater than 0 then</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Then I will set the entry right here, dpij.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">ij to the minimum of those left, right, I think I should put an array syntax.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Alright, syntax wise I forgot, but I can try that.

Okay.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">Okay, let me think.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">to check that all the values are greater than zero if we are taking the minimum here.</div></div><div class="transcription-entry" style="border-top: 1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238); padding: 5px 0px;"><div class="transcription-text">if we've already checked that it's not a rero value, do we need to actually check that?
